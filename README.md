### Known issues
---
* Node class is all sorts of screwed up
* UI is hideous - no work has been put into it.
* No way in mind to carry out node pathing

### To-Do
---
* Figure out node pathing
* Re-make Node class, to allow for node pathing.
* In the distant future, perhaps but some sort of UI work in, maybe.
